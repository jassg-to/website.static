God is eternal, immutable, immaterial, unique, omnipotent, supremely just and good.<br><br>The Universe is God’s creation. It encompasses all rational and non-rational beings, both animate and inanimate, material and immaterial.<br><br>In addition to the corporeal world inhabited by incarnate Spirits, which are human beings, there exists the spiritual world, inhabited by discarnate Spirits.<br><br>Within the Universe there are other inhabited worlds, with beings at different degrees of evolution: some equal, others more or less evolved than earthly Man.<br><br>All the Laws of Nature are Divine Laws because God is their author. They cover both the physical and moral laws.<br>A Human Being is a Spirit incarnated in a material body. The perispirit is the semi-material body which unites the Spirit to the physical body.<br><br>Spirits are the intelligent beings of creation. They constitute the world of the Spirits, which pre-exists and outlives everything.<br><br>Spirits are created simple and ignorant. They evolve intellectually and morally, passing from a lower order to a higher one, until they attain perfection, where they will enjoy unalterable bliss.<br><br>Spirits preserve their individuality before, during, and after each incarnation. Spirits reincarnate as many times as is necessary for their spiritual advancement.<br>Spirits are always progressing. In their multiple physical existences, they may sometimes become stationary but they never regress. The speed of their intellectual and moral progress depends on the efforts they make to attain perfection.<br><br>Spirits belong to different orders according to the degree of perfection they have attained: Pure Spirits, who have attained maximum perfection; Good Spirits, whose predominant desire is towards goodness; and Imperfect Spirits, characterized by their ignorance, their tendency towards evil, and by their inferior passions.<br><br>The Spirits’ relations with Human Beings are constant and have always existed. The Good Spirits attract us towards goodness, sustain us in life’s trials, and help us bear them with courage and resignation. The Imperfect Spirits induce us towards error.<br><br>Jesus is the Guide and Model for all Humankind. The Doctrine He taught and exemplified is the purest expression of God’s Law.<br><br>The morality of Christ, as contained in the Gospels, is the guidance for the secure progress of all Human Beings. Its practice is the solution for all human problems and the objective to be attained by Humankind. Human Beings are given free-will to act, but they must answer for the consequences of their actions.<br><br>Future life reserves for Human Beings penalties and pleasures according to the respect they do or do not show for God’s laws.<br><br>Prayer is an act of adoration for God. It is found in the natural law and is the result of an innate sentiment in every Human Being, just as the idea of the existence of the Creator is innate.<br><br>Prayer makes Human Beings better. Whoever prays with fervor and confidence grows stronger against evil temptations, and God sends the Good Spirits to assist them. This assistance will never be denied when requested with sincerity.',

Hands to work! The plough is ready! The land awaits; plough!<br><br> Go forth and thank God for the glorious task which He has entrusted to you; but pay attention!

It shall be left to the discretion of the Spiritist organizations of each country the decision to adopt them or not, partially or in their entirety, or to adapt them to their own needs or conveniences.<br><br> The organizations affiliated to the ISC shall maintain their autonomy, independence, and freedom of action. Their affiliation with the ISC shall be based upon, and have as its objective, solidarity and fraternal union.<br><br> The activities related in this document are proposed as suggestions. The Spiritist Institutions, at their discretion, may adopt them as their growth and development create the appropriate conditions, and at such a time as their administrators consider suitable.<br><br> Spiritist activities shall always be carried out in a manner compatible with the social environment characteristics and in full compliance with local legislation.',

    'federations-13' => '“The work for the unification in our ranks is urgent, but not rushed. One assertion seems to contradict the other. But it is not so. It is urgent because it defines the goal that we should aim at; but not rushed because it is not granted to us to violate anyone’s conscience.<br><br> Let us preserve the purpose of uniting, approaching, and understanding one another; and, if possible, let us establish at every site where the name of Spiritism has been brought to light, a study group, however small, of the works of Kardec, in the light of the Christ of God.<br><br> The Spiritist Doctrine holds its essential aspects in triple configuration. Thus, no one should be restricted in their desire to work and produce. Let those inclined toward the sciences to cultivate them in their dignity; those who devote themselves to philosophy to ennoble its postulates; and those who consecrate themselves to religion to turn divine its aspirations. Yet, above all, it is necessary that the basis of the Spiritist Doctrine remain in everyone and everything so that we don’t lose the balance at the base over which the organization is raised.<br><br> To teach, but also to put into practice; to believe, but also to study; to counsel, but also to exemplify; to unite, but also to nourish.<br><br> It is indispensable that Spiritism be maintained exactly as it was conveyed to Allan Kardec by the Divine Messengers, that is, without political compromises, without religious professionalism, without degrading personalisms, and without burning desires of conquest of fleeting earthly powers.<br><br> Let us follow Allan Kardec in our studies, aspirations, activities, and deeds so that our faith does not turn into hypnosis, whereby the power of darkness establishes its influence over the weaker minds, enchaining them to centuries of illusion and suffering.<br><br> Let Allan Kardec’s work not only be believed or felt, proclaimed or manifested in our convictions, but also be sufficiently lived, suffered, wept over, and put into practice in our own lives. Without this foundation, it is difficult to forge the Christian-Spiritist character which the troubled world awaits from us through unification.<br><br> May the love of Jesus be upon all, and the truth of Kardec be for all.”<br><br> <span style="color: #456095; font-style: italic;">Bezerra de Menezes (Excerpts from the message “Unification”, channeled by Francisco Candido Xavier, Reformador, Dec/1975</span>',
